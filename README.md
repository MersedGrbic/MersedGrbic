Hello, I’m Mersed, and I’m passionate about building things for the web. I started my journey as a developer back in 2021 when I first started learning Java. I started course on how to code in Java and printed my first "Hello World" in console and once that happened, I was completely hooked to the world of computers. After some time I became bored with console and then I discovered HTML and CSS, and I prefered to see what I am building. Few months later I am here, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js building stuff and finally enjoying my life.
