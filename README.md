Hello! My name is Mersed, and I'm a web developer with a passion for building new things. I first started learning to code in 2021 with Java, and I've since expanded my knowledge to include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, ExpressJS, and NodeJS. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I'm excited to continue learning and building new projects. Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
